Game Design

Summary
  You play as a child going sledding on a snowday, racing down a neighborhood hill and throwing snowballs at other children.
Gameplay
    The player slides down a hill, moving left and right with the d key and a key. A timer counts down as the player sleds down the hill.
    The player can gain time by taking out other children and loses time when they crash into obstacles. The player has unlimited ammo,
    but has to spend time to reload by pressing the space bar. There are several powerups that the player can collect.
Mindset
    A fun quick game that is somewhat challenging and gives the feeling of being a child on a snow day.
